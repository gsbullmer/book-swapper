# Book Swapper (WIP)

An app I'm working on to share books with neighbors.

## TODO
- ~~Setup Webpack for dev~~
- ~~Add React Router~~
- ~~Create some mock book data~~
- ~~Add filtering~~
- Create mock backend (or use [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server))
- Add Redux
- Build out user account/dashboard page
- Add book requesting/messaging functionality
- Add MongoDB/Mongoose
- Add authentication ([Auth0](https://auth0.com/) maybe)
